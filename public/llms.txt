## Services

### Custom Software Development
You define what your business needs — mobile apps, web platforms, intelligent agents, AI automations — and we build it. 100% custom software, no generic solutions. Working demo in 2 weeks, 24/7 ongoing support.

### Digital Transformation Consulting
We visit your company, understand how you actually work, and deliver a report with concrete opportunities, savings estimates, and a prioritized action plan in less than a week. No strings attached — if you don't need anything, we tell you.

### Subsidized Innovation
We identify public grants that fit your company (IGAPE, IA360, Ticket Innova, Kit Digital, data spaces) and design the project and technical report to maximize approval. You pay nothing if the grant is not approved.
